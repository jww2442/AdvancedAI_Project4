"Guitar picks make a huge part of your tone. Especially on acoustic. These are the best acoustic picks on the market today in my opinion. They have a long life and do __MASKED__ your tone. Freshening up the picks is easy just by rubbing them on your carpet or carpet scrap to bring back the original shape." , "brighten"
"Grabbed these on impulse as I needed some new ones. Normally I __MASKED__ the old Fender Medium or Heavy picks, but I got ta say these are great. Stiff but flexible enough to maneuver plus they glide nicely. Not sure what could be said to prove it, but they just feel great." , "used"
"I got this to clean my Washburn acoustic guitar, and it worked great. I used it to clean off the fingerprints and grime, and then would __MASKED__ in a circular motion with my soft, lint-free rag, and it would act like a polish. The finish sparkled afterwards, even in the light. Great product." , "buff"

I recommend the orange one for beginners, and in general would not go much higher than the green ones because when it gets too heavy it does not feel to comfortable anymore and does not sound as well, but it is totally up to what you want. Either way, Dunlop is the best and for a great price." , "lasts"

"I like Fender Mediums, always have, but, I got ta branch out man. Not sure about these picks yet. The feel a little more stiff my usual. I want them to last longer. What happened to the days when you __MASKED__ the same pick around in your pocket for months and played it until it was round ?" , "carried"

"The mic stand pick holder is a great way to keep picks available while playing. I switch between playing guitar and bass so I often change the gauge of the pick I am using. This pick holder is a great way to have the picks available if you change picks often. The holder snaps firmly to the arm of the mic stand and does not __MASKED__ around the arm. It holds the picks firmly, there is no chance they will fall out of the holder." , "slide"

"Very nice product. Strings feel and sound noticeably better plus the white mineral oil smells really good when __MASKED__ to the neck." , "applied"
"I used this on a bass guitar with older strings and it made the strings brighter and more lively. I will try it on all of my guitars as it will prolong the life of most strings. I like the packaging and the small cloth it comes with. I use sections of t shirts to clean my strings and __MASKED__ them inside the packaging along with the cloth. This is a must for any fingerpicking guitar or bass player." , "put"

"I agree with all of the reviews, but have found another area to use fast fret on: THE NUT. When tuning, the strings ( especially the lower wound strings ) __MASKED__ up on the nut which causes the string to pop instead of slide as it would on a roller nut. Dab Fast Fret onto the nut before tuning, and this problem is greatly reduced." , "hang"
"These patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads. Even if you use felt beaters on your kick pedal these pads greatly increase the strength and toughness of your bass drum head in the exact place it is needed most. As far as I can tel these do not change the sound of your head much if at all. They stay exactly where you put them so be sure to get it right the first time.If you have a double bass kick pedal I highly __MASKED__ either this patch or one from another name brand company." , "recommend"

As any other tall person will tell you, finding a strap that adjusts to longer than normal can be frustrating. This strap is very long, if you __MASKED__ it to be.

They leather ends do not rub the guitar finish and the holes do not wear out as fast.

This new strap is plenty long enough, and looks good. My only negative is that it is sharp on the sides of the strap so most players will feel it on their neck, but it sure fits nice and long. I would recommend this to any guitar player." , "bought"

"I think they did it right splitting the light and medium gauges. What resulted for me was the perfect gauge string. They almost __MASKED__ as good as mediums but feature the playability of lights. I also think these strings last a decent amount of time, particularly if you wipe your strings after playing ( which I need to get better at doing ). Bottom line: I highly recommend these; they are the strings that I use and have been using for several years now." , "sound"
"I built a CBG recently and decided to __MASKED__ with these strings as suggested on several websites. The sound I get from the AD & G strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp. The strings seem to hold up well. I can not comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle. These strings sound great, I was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing." , "go"

My instructor of the guitar suggested I really read the information about all of the holders and then make my choice of the one that seemed to be light-weight yet sturdy to not fall over, looked professional, and could be the possibility of THE one I would recommend and __MASKED__ again.

"this stand is small but does the job.and __MASKED__ up in to a small package.i have one for each guitar" , "folds"
"It was cheap to buy but works just fine. I thought it might not be tall enough to hold my guitar securely but it does. The arms are coated with a soft material that prevents scratching. It is small but the arms stretch to __MASKED__ almost any guitar securely. Perhaps it might be too light for a very heavy guitar. In that case, I would recommend a stand that is taller and heavier." , "hold"

I can say its built much better than I __MASKED__ it would be. Feels like its built to last." , "thought"

"Plenty of cord to move around with. Makes it less likely that I am going to __MASKED__ the cord on a down stroke. Just what the guitar doctor ordered." , "clip"
"So good that I bought another one. Love the heavy cord and gold connectors. Guitar sounds great. I just learned last night how to coil them up. I guess I should read instructions more carefully. But no harm __MASKED__, still works great !" , "done"
"I thought I was using good guitar cables but I kept getting intermittence with one.So I tried this Monster cable. It eliminated the problem.My only minor complaint is that it is very stiff. This is minor but no matter what I do it curls up unless you have it fully __MASKED__ would still recommend it though." , "extended.I"
"Monster Cable is one of the things on earth we can __MASKED__ on ! Seriously speaking all my cables are Monsters, yes they are pricy and sometimes very much, true.But they last really lifetime and I never ever had to complain or heard a friend complaining on Monster products.PEACE" , "count"
"It is a great option, if not simply the best. Monster __MASKED__ it all in quality. Gob bless monster everyway" , "knows"
"Quality is there in construction and signal passing. We never have problems with our Monster gold cables. Conversely, we have other cables __MASKED__ out on us periodically." , "crap"
"I would def __MASKED__ this to anyone but for electric only. If you are going to be playing acoustic I would get their specific acoustic cable. This is a very heavy guage. Sounds great !" , "recommend"
"Very well __MASKED__. No problems. Should be able to stand up to any use or abuse." , "made"
"The plastic is pretty lightweight, but it is a big help. I keep various guitar picks, clips, pencils, etc. on it which kept __MASKED__ off when I just set them in front of the music. Glad I bought it." , "falling"
"I __MASKED__ this for my daughters acoustic guitar so she could play through an amp. It fits very well and sounds great !" , "bought"
"This mic is fine. One should __MASKED__ that it has quite low gain and requires the use of a boost/preamp for the guitar sound to be heard." , "know"
"Could not __MASKED__ to fit small sound hole. Once in sound hole pickup did not work at all. Would not buy it." , "get"
"I have been using the EXPs for some time now on electic-acoustics and they have become my go-to string. I __MASKED__ the coating to be less noticeable than on El * * * rs and tonal variations to be less from string to string and set-to-set. Highly recommended." , "find"
"We have an old acoustic around the house, but I rarely play it, opting instead for the electric. This is going to be hard to believe, but the strings on the acoustic were last changed more than two decades ago.When we __MASKED__ these new strings on the guitar ( Lotus ), the sound, as you might imagine, was incredible -- bright and clear.These are fairly pricey, but I am very impressed with the quality." , "put"
"These strings last and they moderated some of the booming I get from other strings. I __MASKED__ the EXP Phosphor bronze on my other dreads." , "use"
"These strings sound great. I __MASKED__ the sustained bright tone. They work well with my cedar top guitar. Easy on the fingers too." , "Love"
"not worth the price or matched the hype that you hear and read about. GHS strings are much cheaper and much better strings than these. I think they __MASKED__ a week on my guitar until I could get some more GHS or Slinky Acoustics on it." , "lasted"
"are hard to __MASKED__ when it comes to durability. ( except the steel ones ). I use it when I travel on a plane especially" , "beat"
"This is the best case ever for the money ! I have purchased four other cases and none are as well __MASKED__ as the Gator Deluxe. I like this case so much, I plan to purchase two more this week." , "constructed"
"Works perfectly for both my Martin dreadnought and my Fender Stratocaster. Solid unit, good material and construction, though it is __MASKED__ in China apparently -- but hey thats why its such a bargain !" , "made"
"Well built and solid stand. It keeps the guitar well protected and looks nice too. Some stands __MASKED__ the guitar with only a hallowed little tube on the bottom, which breaks easily from the weight of the guitar. This stand holds the guitar with two solid metal bars, which should last a long time. It can hold both acoustic and electric guitars. Highly recommend it." , "hold"
"very well __MASKED__ of heavy metal framework. has a very solid base. the neoprene sleeve is thick and soft enough to protect your guitar. the top neck clasp keeps the guitar from tipping forward and the quick release really works. probably the best stand." , "made"
"Have had one for years. Has __MASKED__ many gigs and rehearsals, and many months in the trunk of my car. Harsh environment !" , "survived"
"This does what you expect, it __MASKED__ up a guitar. What can else can be said ? It has a swing lever that keeps the instrument an an unfortunate accidents. It is portable, folds up easily for storage. I usually have a guitar on it all the time." , "stands"
"Not easy to __MASKED__ up, hard to tighten down. Works well enough as a filter once you get it placed." , "set"
"Its poorly made with attention to detail. I ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at Amazon. But they will not __MASKED__ down all the way and are losse. It is useless ! ! ! Other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine." , "screw"
"I bought this compression pedal to __MASKED__ my leads a little extra oomph and it does just that. When playing hammer-ons and pull-offs, sometimes it can be difficult to get them to sound as loud as the rest of your picking, but not when using this pedal. It amplifies your quieter sounds and levels off the louder ones to give a smoothe sound. Works great if used correctly. Not to be used with dynamic picking sounds because you will lose that louder/softer sound.I use this with a Gibson Les Paul, and Washburn Hollowbody through a Fender Super Champ amp along with other pedals. It can cause some major feedback if using heavy distortion." , "give"
"This is a great pedal to have in your setup, for those times you __MASKED__ a clean sound that will cut through the mix, yet will not just sound blaringly loud and undefined. I used a Boss compression pedal for many years, and the Dyna Comp was definitely a refreshing step in the right direction. It just sounds more organic, and less sterile than the Boss Pedal. I also think in this case, less is more, as far as the controls are concerned." , "want"
"I __MASKED__ MXR products however I am always Leary of the metal button on pedals because of the possibility of the pop factor. The dyna comp does still equal out my sound from clean to overdrive. A must for pedal boards." , "like"
"This is actually a very sturdy yet light weight drum throne. The only issue I have is that the seat can __MASKED__ if not tightened properly, allowing the bolt to scratch the metal post ( not a big deal )." , "swivel"
"Comes with Adapter.This thing controls your tone so well ! ! ! ! ! __MASKED__ about it is just so much worth the money im starting to fall in love with MXR !" , "Everything"
"I use is this mount to support a Samson meteor mic. It works great. I would definitely __MASKED__ this again. The mounting is designed to work on any diameter microphone stand. It has good positive adjustments even with a heavy mic on the end." , "buy"
"Really great clamp, __MASKED__ to a vertical pipe very securely, great quality. A very nice addition to my collection. I highly recommend." , "fastens"
"I was very skeptical to buy a Wuhan china because ive had bad experiences before and their quality control is almost non-existent.That being said, the china I __MASKED__ is amazing its a nice thick little cymbal and has a great sharp tone and fast decay.My opinion of Wuhan has been raised quite a bit." , "received"
"If looking for that oriental sound, this is it. Nicely __MASKED__. Some folks expect something different, I suspect. It is not a cymbal that you use like a crash or ride, it is more like a splash and at that it is for use for a particular sound. Highly recommend, And when I bought it was very well priced - like half what I could find used ( and this was NEW ! )." , "made"
"I have a Boss OD which I realize now matches well with my little Vox tube amp, so I use this Bad Monkey pedal when I go direct for low level or headphone playing. Good price, good tone, pretty versatile, but I __MASKED__ the mid boost and harmonics I get from the Boss. The BM might work better with solid state." , "like"
"Virtually __MASKED__ all outside sound, allowing you to dial in a comfortable volume during rehersal and recording sessions. Nice, flat response." , "eliminates"
"These do a great job at passively eliminating noise while allowing you to __MASKED__ your metronome ( or a mix from a soundboard ) perfectly. They are certainly worth the price." , "hear"
"these do a good job of __MASKED__ out the sound. They work very well. Would recommend it to other people" , "isolating"
"these things muffle sound great. they have good sound quality. perfect for __MASKED__ loud drums. perfect for drowning out people" , "recording"
"__MASKED__ perfectly. Nice feel to it and seems sturdy. You just have to remember not to turn on the keyboard with your foot down otherwise it switches polarity and does the opposite of what you want it to." , "Works"
"Great accessary for Yamaha keyboards. Fits and __MASKED__ well. Very adequate construction, should last for many hours of playing at home or out !" , "works"
"__MASKED__ what it should and Yamaha quality. The price seems very good for what you get out of this pedal. I am using on a Yamaha board." , "Does"
"I bought it just so I could learn a little bit of guitar. It sounds good and looks really nice. I __MASKED__ compliments on it." , "get"
"I have many expensive cases for my guitars and recently started playing bass, but not too serious just wanted a nice little case for it. Boy was i __MASKED__, this case is awesome, great quality, fits bass without any problems and the storage inside is great. Definetly reccomend this case" , "surprised"
"I had a Cannon brand clutch and I bought this one to replace it. What I like about this one is how the release lever works. On the Cannon the lever was vertical. This made actuating it a less natural motion. With this one you hit it with a down stroke of your stick and it releases. That motion is much more natural and this makes it easier to __MASKED__. An argument could be made that this one coule be easier to actuate accidentally but I have had no issue with it.Aside from the actuation of the release it is also well made and works very well." , "use"
"It works well as a standard clutch, as a drop clutch its very iffy. the top part spins around when you __MASKED__ the lever so you have to grab it and move it back so you can hit it again." , "hit"
"I like to hit things. I use drums so nobody else __MASKED__ hurt. I need the sticks to most effectively channel my aggression into the drums and not, say, local wildlife. These have the sweetest tone for battery-based abuse. Thanks Vic ! Also, flammable !" , "gets"
"I have always liked these sticks. They are solid, look good and feel good. You will always get quality from vic firth. Only downer is they seem to __MASKED__ faster then some sticks such as Vaders." , "break"
"These sticks are solid hickory, which is insanely durable, and sounds great for classic rock, and punk rock drums. These sticks are weight, and sound __MASKED__, so each pair will sound and feel almost identical." , "matched"
"easy to install, holds the guitar away from the wall somewhat, and __MASKED__ it off of the floor away from the animals when I have it out of the case. great find, well worth the purchase price.: )" , "keeps"
