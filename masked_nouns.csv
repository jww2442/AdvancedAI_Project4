"The primary job of this device is to block the breath that would otherwise produce a popping sound, while allowing your voice to pass through with no noticeable reduction of volume or high frequencies. The double cloth filter blocks the pops and lets the voice through with no coloration. The metal __MASKED__ mount attaches to the mike stand secure enough to keep it attached. The goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it." , "clamp"
"Nice windscreen protects my MXL mic and prevents __MASKED__. Only thing is that the gooseneck is only marginally able to hold the screen in position and requires careful positioning of the clamp to avoid sagging." , "pops"

"I acknowledge that this is a __MASKED__ opinion - perhaps I just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards. But while I loved the sound and functionality of this wah-wah pedal, it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable. I suspected that the potentiameter was shot, so I had that replaced, but the same problems reoccurred. Like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it.Good product, but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit I had." , "minority"

"The screws are too long for my very thin bodied Gibson SG __MASKED__. I can not find shorter screws which fall into the pin so that the straplock will work either -- -the heads are all too large.I believe I used these on my Gibson Les Paul Custom years ago, and they worked perfectly. Not on my newer SG though -- at least with the new screws it comes with.Fender Start appears to take the system well -- only time will tell." , "Classic"

"The Dunlop strap locks work pretty well, but the standard hole cut in a standard leather strap is not big enough to accomidate the locking buttons. The strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes. This for all intents and purposes means that you will not be able to use that strap with standard strap __MASKED__ ever again.They do work as advertised and they are easy to take on and off for strap adjustment when required." , "buttons"
"Great replacement string for your ukulele, great to have on hand in case or replace your __MASKED__ after you get your uku." , "strings"
"Works as it should. Nice __MASKED__ and I think it will be durable. Simple to attach to your mic stand and adjust as needed. It will improve your recordings, getting the pops and sssss out of your sound without having to do sound processing as much anyway." , "materials"
"What a difference a pop filter makes, I use on a condenser mic, it lets me get a little more gain input, __MASKED__ on easy and holds good, the flex piece holding the filter could be a little more rigid but does the job. I like the way it looks when mounted on the mic stand extension, It has improved the vocal tracks. Just one more affordable improvement for the home studio." , "clamps"
"When I bought these I was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording. Once these are in __MASKED__ they work just fine, the problem is that getting them into position can be harder than it looks. The device clamps onto a microphone stand and then you adjust the goose neck to get the filter where you need it. The filter and the goose neck are fairly heavy and as such it was often a struggle to get the filter where I wanted it and to keep it there.On the plus side, the device looks nice and professional and it has held up over three years of use." , "position"
"It works as a pop filter should and is a huge __MASKED__ over my make-shift panty hose pop filter. What else is there to say ?" , "upgrade"
"filter works very well and looks professional. only __MASKED__ i am having is that the clamp seems to work specifically with a mic stand or similar type structure." , "problem"
"I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the __MASKED__ that are on here lately this thing is not good. Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open ( which oddly had staples holding it closed )." , "comments"
"it keeps the spit off the mic and looks cool when recording - it does great at keeping you mouth off the __MASKED__ so you dont breath it out and fits great on the stands with easy clamp" , "mic"
"works very well, keeps the popping to a bare __MASKED__, easy to install, cleans in a flash, lightweight and works" , "minimum"
"When you record singing, you need this to prevent the pop __MASKED__. It is definitely worth it. It also makes you looks professional." , "sound"
"Use this for home recordings and some voice over recordings for work. I like the long neck on it and its a double filter so you get a tad bit extra. I tested it against my single filter and it did make a difference, as expected. It makes __MASKED__ that if you have an additional layer there it will filter more effectively, but I wasnt sure if it would effect tone or highs, and I didnt notice either effected." , "sense"
"works well but wish it was a bit heavier and the __MASKED__ was a little better made. but other than that works as intended." , "construction"
"Tested this on my Blue Yeti USB Microphone and could tell the __MASKED__ with the POP filter on right away. Good investment." , "difference"
"A needed accessory for any vocal recording, period. My only __MASKED__ about this model is why the straight bracket part needs to stick out so dang far, since you can bend the arm out in any position anyway." , "gripe"
"Good solid __MASKED__. It hooks onto the mic stand and works as advertised, i.e removes the pops from vocal recordings." , "construction"
"Very sturdy and awesome pop filter. Adjustable to any __MASKED__ you want and just a great pop filter ! I would recommend this to anyone !" , "length"

"I tried this but ended up going back to Tortex. I like the satin __MASKED__ on the Tortex better and the way it bends. The Ultex has a little brighter attack though and wears out less quickly. Ultex sounds more like the Fender celluloid." , "finish"
"Guitar __MASKED__ make a huge part of your tone. Especially on acoustic. These are the best acoustic picks on the market today in my opinion. They have a long life and do brighten your tone. Freshening up the picks is easy just by rubbing them on your carpet or carpet scrap to bring back the original shape." , "picks"
"Grabbed these on impulse as I needed some new ones. Normally I used the old Fender Medium or __MASKED__ picks, but I got ta say these are great. Stiff but flexible enough to maneuver plus they glide nicely. Not sure what could be said to prove it, but they just feel great." , "Heavy"
"I got this to clean my Washburn acoustic guitar, and it worked great. I used it to clean off the fingerprints and grime, and then would buff in a circular motion with my soft, lint-free rag, and it would act like a __MASKED__. The finish sparkled afterwards, even in the light. Great product." , "polish"
"This product is excellent. Cleaning is thorough and leaves no residue. Made my little Martin __MASKED__ almost as good as new." , "look"
"this is the one that everyone told me I should use, being new to guitar I figured one polish ( car ) has to work well, that was very incorrect on my __MASKED__, this is for the delicate woods and preserves them far better than ordinary polishes" , "part"
"Great __MASKED__, combined with the Fishman Aura Spectrum D.I. you will have an excellent experience. Even the pick up by itself into a quality amp will make you happy." , "pickup"
"What can I say ? These are probably the most well-known pads available and probably the best. This was the best price I could find on __MASKED__ and they arrived as described via very prompt shipping." , "Amazon"
"These are laser cut pads for your studio monitors. I feel more vibration from a hard __MASKED__ spinning on my desktop than the sounds coming out of my speakers. And they look professional too." , "drive"
"Ive been trying different strings for years ! ! ! Ive been stuck on __MASKED__ for some time now and wanted a change. These are very bright and clean ! ! ! ! very playable ! ! !" , "elixirs"
"I bought these to put on my really old __MASKED__ acoustic. The guitar still sounds amazing, and these strings certainly fit my budget, and provide a great sound." , "Martin"
"These are good strings, for a good __MASKED__. I have purchased these strings several times and they sound good and last a long time." , "price"
"But these seemed to work well on the __MASKED__ I was re-stringing. My son thought they were great and he knows quite a bit more.Recommend." , "guitar"
"Brand __MASKED__, good string, good tone, seem to last awhile but I change strings often so never really know how long a set will last." , "name"
"I used to use Elixir Nano __MASKED__, and a good as they sound, they do not last. These do. great sounding strings." , "string"
"Fast shipping, great __MASKED__ and most of all great stings, very satisfied would buy these strings again and would recommend to a friend." , "price"
"If your not sure what to buy you are prob looking for the light __MASKED__. These are a littl ehard to play." , "strings"
"I really like the mediums. They are able to play the biggest variety of __MASKED__ without being to heavy or not durable enough." , "styles"
"I am not a connoisseur but __MASKED__ great about these strings. They have pretty good sound but they seem to die quickly." , "nothing"
"Love these __MASKED__. Have used them for years. Feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever. Highly recommend." , "picks"
"I know that pick choosing is a personal matter. I choose this specific model because the __MASKED__ and flexibility are perfect for me." , "thickness"
"I think Tortex / Delrin picks are the __MASKED__ that others are judged by.Durable, good to gripping surface, easy to identify thicknesses by color.The only way I can think of to improve these would be to replace the black ink logo and script with some sort of raised embossing.Then your fingers will not smudge and the grip would be even better.Take a look at `` Cactus Picks '' to get an idea of what I mean." , "standard"
"I like the picks a __MASKED__ ! They are super strong and look like can take a lot of use in a good shape ! Recommended" , "lot"
"Whatever size you are looking for Dunlop is the best option. It lasts long, sounds great, and feels very nice. It is probably the most favored pick among all companies. I recommend the __MASKED__ one for beginners, and in general would not go much higher than the green ones because when it gets too heavy it does not feel to comfortable anymore and does not sound as well, but it is totally up to what you want. Either way, Dunlop is the best and for a great price." , "orange"
"I love these picks. The flex is just right for me, and they last __MASKED__. I have never had one break." , "forever"
"Good __MASKED__, great feel and brings out sound loudly. Mostly for Electrics. I prefer the lighter sound of the Acoustic but these work very well with my friends Electric, Fender." , "picks"
"I think these are great for the __MASKED__ they give you. John Mayer uses these picks and hes one of my favorite guitarist so I am sticking with these." , "price"
"In a fit of boredom or curiosity, I decided that I would check out some the other picks out there. After spending too much money for various brands of picks, including every model of the __MASKED__ picks, I came back home to Dunlop Tortex green. They stil play great, sound great against steel strings, and last a long time." , "DAVA"
"I like it. Grip is good and the __MASKED__ is just right for me. I wish the tip was sharper but it is good as is" , "thickness"
"__MASKED__ is great i really like their picks there may be better but these have fit the bill i prefer the yellow ones they are a little thinner" , "Tortex"
"i ordered one pack of these and got an entire __MASKED__ ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! either way the picks are great although i would suggest the Jazz picks over these" , "box"
"I enjoyed this set very much due to the variety of picks, as it was interesting to try different __MASKED__. Dunlop picks are great !" , "models"
"__MASKED__ picks, buy it. This pick, rocks for me, im a fan of dunlop for many years and all there products are amazing." , "Great"
"I have always used tortex picks. I like them a lot and they last forever ( almost: ) these were a little thick for my tastes. The red ones are a little thinner and give better action for strumming and also for fast alternate picking patterns.If you like a medium thick __MASKED__ though, these are rockin." , "pick"
"I have been using Dunlop picks for a long time. Good __MASKED__, grip and not too heavy or thick. Good deal." , "feel"
"I bought these because I wanted durable, flexible __MASKED__ for easy strumming. I would recomend these to anyone that needs more stable strumming." , "picks"
"This nylon pick has great play feel. It is stiff enough to pick individual strings and still __MASKED__ comfortable stumming chords." , "feels"
"i like these kind of picks because they have some grip to them, normal picks i use slip out of my __MASKED__ some times but these dont.if you hate droping your pick while playing, get these." , "fingers"
"These picks have just the right amount of give to really make strumming sound nice and clean. Very forgiving on __MASKED__ also. Great for beginners." , "technique"
"the are last forever ! much better than plastic ones, especially if you stay in the light __MASKED__. TH ANK you !" , "thickens"
"I only use Dunlops. For a __MASKED__ of reasons. First, the texture of the plastic gives a good sound, and easier to hold on to. Second, the `` grippy '' texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to. Thirdly, they make many sizes, for all the right occasions. Two thumbs up !" , "number"
"This pick is great for strumming. Some people are complaining about the grip but they are better than celluloid picks in that __MASKED__. If you are looking for the best grip you need to find a pick that has a textured grip." , "regard"
"So, these picks are really nice, but the __MASKED__ is not what you will get. These picks are translucent purple. Other than the strange color, they are good picks. They really do help with speed and accuracy. Great for mandolin playing.Updated: Amazon has changed the image for this item, so now the picture really does show what you will get." , "picture"
"I dont know why they are called big stubby. They are on the small side. Way to thick for me. They do sound good though and will last a long time. I feel like I am playing with a nickle. I like the indentation. Helps the __MASKED__ a lot. I should have paid more attention to the size and thickness. Still looking for the right picks for me. If these were slimmer and a bit larger I would buy again." , "grip"
"Looking for __MASKED__ for bass, this one did not work for me, it is thick and hard, good attack.but only thumb picks work, so i can use my fingers too." , "picks"
"I have them in __MASKED__ which makes them stick out. They have the little cut out to make it easier to grip and hold when I am playing the mandolin. Already planning on purchasing more." , "purple"
"I use different kinds of picks, this one is very special, the __MASKED__ rings out really pleasant, and great for speed picking too !" , "strings"
"These are shred picks, they are very accurate. Pinch harmonics come easily. The point is made to scream over wound strings, gallops, are a breeze. I gave one to the other guitarist in my __MASKED__ now he only uses them." , "band"
"I love these picks. Great for lead playing, and with small __MASKED__ like I have, they feel great ! Nice quality pick." , "fingers"
"just to let people know off the __MASKED__ i can tell you these picks are small, and if you are used to big picks these might turn you off for a while. But trust me when i say that once you get used to these picks and you start using proper technique these picks will improve your technique rapidly.i never thought i would say that a pick helped me improve playing but it does. now when i try any bigger pick i even use those picks with more skill now because of these picks. trust me if you put up with these picks for a while and you get used to them you will improve or at least i and many other people agree.: D" , "bat"
"They are half the __MASKED__ of a regular pick. Bit too thick for me. Sound nice. Will last forever. Wish I had sized them before I bought them." , "size"
"I love these little guys. The small size forces me to hold it so just the very tips is exposed. They have a nice textured grip. I bought the red __MASKED__ this time so I can see them when I drop them !" , "ones"
"Been using these for longer than a decade, and met many people who prefer minimal picks, and jazz III among them. This is the closest to playing with bare __MASKED__ that I can get." , "hand"
"the title says it all. it may take a while getting use to these smaller picks but in the long run you will e happy that you tried these picks. also since these picks are smaller, i found it was easy to do pinch __MASKED__ on these compared to bigger picks, so if you are having a hard time with pinch harmonics try these out." , "harmonics"
"I tried three of these on a whim and they impressed me favorably. In fact, they were so good that I purchased ten more when I went back to the same __MASKED__ store. My favorites are mandolin picks like Golden Gate or Grisman `` Dawgs ''. The round side of the XH Dunlop Gels gives me a similar attack and a nice warm tone. I would recommend these to anyone." , "music"
"I have used the Extra Heavy picks for many years but am still searching for that perfect pick. Its strong enough to play __MASKED__ and some blues style rifts but not so strong it cracks and brakes. I do like the fact it wont turn to powder or fray while playing either but it does wear out fast when playing on heavy gauge strings." , "metal"
"I like Fender Mediums, always have, but, I got ta branch out man. Not sure about these picks yet. The feel a little more stiff my usual. I want them to last longer. What happened to the days when you carried the same pick around in your __MASKED__ for months and played it until it was round ?" , "pocket"
"They play well and hold up well ( never had one break ) They are my second favorite pick. But this __MASKED__ is better in some songs than my favorite." , "pick"
"Fits nicely on my mic stand and hold a butt __MASKED__ of picks. It is quite tight on my picks, but I imagine it will loosen slightly as it gets used." , "load"
"I bought this thing not thinking I would use it too much, but wanted it for future use, I was wrong, no more misplacing __MASKED__ for me. Highly recommended, also fits on my guitar stand, very cool." , "picks"
"Works really well ! This is very convenient for when your on stage and are switching to fingering style or something. You can just drop the pick in your __MASKED__ and pick a new one up when ready." , "hands"
"The mic stand pick holder is a great way to keep picks available while playing. I switch between playing guitar and bass so I often change the gauge of the pick I am using. This pick holder is a great way to have the picks available if you change picks often. The holder snaps firmly to the arm of the mic stand and does not slide around the arm. It holds the picks firmly, there is no __MASKED__ they will fall out of the holder." , "chance"
"I put it on the boom of my mic stand. Tight on some, not on others. I need to put a shim on it for some __MASKED__ to keep the picks in place." , "stands"
"I wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the __MASKED__. My guitar would probably not be happy without it." , "trick"
"This is a upgraded version of the guitar humdifier, The first one had that green stuff that florists use in it and you used a plastic syringe to ad water to it. This has a replaceable sponge, you take it out, soak it and squeeze out excess then put it back in __MASKED__, would say it gets more humidity out." , "container"
"A simple system for gettting humidity into the __MASKED__; The price is just right and it is very simple to use." , "guitar"
"Fits nicely into my acoustic guitars. Just requires you to dampen the sponge with distilled __MASKED__. Luckily I keep that on hand !" , "water"
"I bought this guitar humidifier for my Taylor.I received exactly what I purchased and works as it should.This product has been recommended to me by many other __MASKED__ players around me.It is a simple design that fits perfectly between the strings.Easy to use because really all you have to do is moisturize the sponge and keep it in the plastic container.Price is good." , "guitar"
"This is good for now ! Keeps my guitar from drying out, warping, cracking, ! For the __MASKED__ it works ! Recommend this product." , "money"
"Cleans your __MASKED__ and makes your fingers go across the strings a little faster.This is a good long lasting product and a little goes a long way.It is VERY safe for guitar finishes." , "strings"
"This __MASKED__ will lube up your strings pretty well ! The only downside is that it leaves tiny pieces of fuzz on my strings after a few times of use- but it comes with a little cloth that I assume is meant for this little inconvenience." , "stuff"
"I really love this. Tends to be very linty with __MASKED__ but it is still a very good product. Recommended." , "time"
"Very nice product. Strings feel and sound noticeably better plus the white mineral oil __MASKED__ really good when applied to the neck." , "smells"
"I used this on a bass guitar with older strings and it made the strings brighter and more lively. I will try it on all of my guitars as it will prolong the life of most strings. I like the packaging and the small cloth it comes with. I use sections of t shirts to clean my strings and put them inside the __MASKED__ along with the cloth. This is a must for any fingerpicking guitar or bass player." , "packaging"
"This product is great, I use it after every session. Keeps your strings clean and conditions the fret board. Every __MASKED__ player should keep this in their case." , "guitar"
"Not an expert but it is cheap and simple and cleans and protects the __MASKED__. Hope that helps thank you" , "strings"
"I agree with all of the reviews, but have found another area to use fast fret on: THE NUT. When tuning, the strings ( especially the lower wound strings ) hang up on the nut which causes the string to pop instead of slide as it would on a roller nut. Dab __MASKED__ Fret onto the nut before tuning, and this problem is greatly reduced." , "Fast"
"These patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum __MASKED__. Even if you use felt beaters on your kick pedal these pads greatly increase the strength and toughness of your bass drum head in the exact place it is needed most. As far as I can tel these do not change the sound of your head much if at all. They stay exactly where you put them so be sure to get it right the first time.If you have a double bass kick pedal I highly recommend either this patch or one from another name brand company." , "heads"
"This has saved my bass drum head from many holes. Also has no affect on __MASKED__ of bass drum.Would recommend." , "sound"
"they look slick and __MASKED__ really good, i would recommend this to anyone that needs a bass drum patch or so" , "work"
"Good stitching, no __MASKED__. Awesome strap. Fits straps locks just fine. Perfectly happy with this strap. Thank you earnie ball !" , "slippage"
"perfect size for us big guys. i do recommend some snap __MASKED__ for it though......" , "locks"
"A nice simple adjustable strap that has well reinforced __MASKED__ to hold the attachment posts on my guitar without any worries. It is a bit slippery so for top-heavy guitars like Les Pauls the neck tends to keep slipping down so you have to support it with your fret hand a little. I thinking of sewing a silicon mat on the underside so it will stay put on my shoulder." , "ends"
"For the money, this strap is as good as any other __MASKED__ strap. Plus, it was made in the U.S.A. !" , "poly"
"This is just what it looks like - a very economical strap. The great thing about it is the __MASKED__. As any other tall person will tell you, finding a strap that adjusts to longer than normal can be frustrating. This strap is very long, if you need it to be. For the price, very hard to beat this. Works well withDunlop Dual Design Straplok System, Blacktoo. Overall, a good buy, for a backup strap or your primary." , "length"
"For at great price, this strap does all that it is suppose to do. It is very will made, has the Ernie __MASKED__ logo on it and works just fine." , "Ball"
"Made of quality __MASKED__. I do not need anything fancy, because I am a simle person ! It does a first class job on my vintage electric guitar !" , "material"
"Great inexpensive strap. Really, what more can you say ? I wanted something to hold my __MASKED__ up, and it does just that." , "guitar"
"this is a great strap. nice tight fit, snug and __MASKED__ and very flexible. Best part this strap gets long long long. Yep here it is." , "secure"
"Great build quality, works like it should. Feels comfortable to wear also. No complaints at all: ) Great color also considering my guitar is a __MASKED__ of green: D" , "shade"
"I like purple, and it is purple. The __MASKED__ is sturdy. It works, what else needs to be said; it arrived timely, is decent quality, and a nice color." , "strap"
"Got three of these straps as we got tired of changing them whenever we needed one on a different guitar. This is a great strap for the money. They leather ends do not rub the guitar finish and the __MASKED__ do not wear out as fast. If you want to spend more money, you can and get a little better ( leather extends higher on the strap on the more expensive ones -- nicer ) but if you want something that is functional and looks good this is a good value." , "holes"
"This is a very nice guitar strap in light gray. The strap material and the double-leather ends are heavy duty and should last a long __MASKED__. I got this at an awesome price too !" , "time"
"I have both black and white Ernie ball __MASKED__, really comfortable, easy to adjust, holds guitar securely, and both colors look great with black guitars !" , "straps"
"Finally I found a long strap for my new guitar. I had bought one earlier that was leather, but was way too short. It felt like my guitar hung around my neck. This new strap is plenty long enough, and looks good. My only negative is that it is sharp on the sides of the strap so most __MASKED__ will feel it on their neck, but it sure fits nice and long. I would recommend this to any guitar player." , "players"
"This microphone is the best microphone I have ever owned. It is very dense, a little quiet, but the sound is absolutely brilliant quality. It is very clear __MASKED__, and very well built. Get this mic. You will not regret it." , "sounding"
"this is a great stand for __MASKED__ looking to mic up their guitar amp, seems well built and rugged, although the mic clip is just a cheap plastic component you should immediately replace !" , "anyone"
"This is a well made table top stand. The __MASKED__ of the stand holds the mic and wire in place with ease. I would get this stand again." , "weight"
"really cool looking __MASKED__, works well and is just overall awesome, you cant break it either becuase its in wood" , "rosin"
"Got this for my electric __MASKED__. I am able to adjust it to the length I play with. Very sturdy guitar strap." , "guitar"
"A perfect __MASKED__ for the original I replaced. These fit the American sized pots perfectly. The price at Amazon was the best I could find without buying used crap." , "match"
"I replaced the metric pots in my Greco __MASKED__ and needed new top hats. These look great and work perfectly." , "LP"
"I like replacing pickguards, truss rod covers, knobs, etc. on my guitars. This is a nice part. Looks awesome on my Les __MASKED__ Traditional Desert Burst." , "Paul"
"These are stylish and fit perfectly on my __MASKED__. They are even and not warped like the stock ones were." , "guitar"
"this mic gives a great range of recording purposes ! Seems well built and rugged, the only complaint I have is that the face plate on the front fell off after only a month of light use, they must use a cheap adhesive for it, I had to clean both surfaces and give it a __MASKED__ of gorilla glue to get the plate back on" , "dab"
"Last forever and easy to hold __MASKED__. Not much more to say but there really isnt much more that needs to be said. My favorite picks." , "onto"
"Great all round pick, one of my favorites. __MASKED__ to grip and are pretty quite. They wear out extremely fast though." , "Easy"
"I like these pics. I use a variety of thickness and this are moderately thin. good for fast strumming, etc. they feel good in your __MASKED__ and are easy to hold onto. I would buy them again." , "hand"
"This is a basic EQ pedal, that is a bit noisy in my testing. Even when running on battery power, there is a bit of __MASKED__ that is just enough to be annoying in my rig and probably enought to be very annoying in some higher gain rigs." , "hiss"
"I have a __MASKED__ T Bucket acoustic guitar and I put heavy guage strings on it. As beginner these strings were not good for me. I tried these and they blow away the heavy guage strings. Good quality. Glad I bought these." , "Fender"
"I read the reviews on __MASKED__ Ball strings. I have to say that I love the strings. They have a rich sound that brings my acoustic alive." , "Ernie"
"Ernie __MASKED__ is really on to something with the Slinky series, offering a nice range of weights. I swear by the Slinky, after being conned into a a set of Mexican-Made Martins." , "Ball"
"Ernie Ball Acoustic __MASKED__ will bring your tired guitar to life. My playing sucks - sounds better with these strings. Bright and warm at the same time. Great tone. Easy on the fingers" , "strings"
"I have a cedar topped acoustic and these strings brought it to life without losing the cedar smoothness. No mud, clear mids and highs with clashing. Mounted them with the brass tone pins and this guitar just __MASKED__ like a bell now. Love it." , "rings"
"I think they did it right splitting the light and medium gauges. What resulted for me was the perfect gauge string. They almost sound as good as mediums but feature the playability of __MASKED__. I also think these strings last a decent amount of time, particularly if you wipe your strings after playing ( which I need to get better at doing ). Bottom line: I highly recommend these; they are the strings that I use and have been using for several years now." , "lights"
"I built a CBG recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites. The sound I get from the AD & G strings sound great wit the __MASKED__ pickup and a tube amp. The strings seem to hold up well. I can not comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle. These strings sound great, I was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing." , "piezo"
"I use these strings on my gig __MASKED__ because the are light enough I can play a couple hours without shredding my fingers but they are big enough to give it a nice warm sound" , "guitar"
"This __MASKED__ is designed to work on electric guitars, not acoustic or acoustic/electric guitars. The arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars. This is however perfect for my LP and SG guitars. I love its size and portability." , "stand"
"I needed a small, collapsible stand which would fit in my backpack with my little amp cables and __MASKED__. This is perfect, love it." , "stuff"
"I needed some little, easy, and portable guitar stands for the __MASKED__. This does it perfectly, well. While being light and portable." , "stage"
"Easy to pack, easy on the instrument, light __MASKED__ but sturdy. An excellent value and a great gift idea too !" , "weight"
"This stand easily __MASKED__, and holds my Mandolin in a scratch-proof stance. Not good for smaller instruments, like the name may imply to some. An attempt to hold a smaller ukulele miserably failed, but everything from Tenor uke and up, did just fine !: )" , "folds"
"Small light and stays out of the way, it just works. Folds up if needed for __MASKED__. I use with Stratacoustic." , "travel"
"It is so small and cute and totally fits my __MASKED__ with and without the bag. So if it is outside the bag of course I can showcase my guitar. The guitar inside the bag fits perfectly too. It stands as it should and it was a snap ( literally ) to set up it was like three steps or something. Wow. I am very impressed considering the price ! ! ! !" , "guitar"
"this little stand is great. I am looking at it right now, across the room, holding my Zager guitar. it is light, non obtrusive, holds the guitar well, and it is portable when Mr. Guitar and I take a trip together. I highly recommend it. keeps that guitar off the __MASKED__, floor, table or anywhere else it is not really suposed to be." , "bed"
"Not your average Giant Clumsy __MASKED__ Stand, but it works. The only drawback is that it is literally not big enough to provide a very stable base of support. If you have toddlers or rambunctious dogs, or even fairly large cats, a larger stand might be a better choice. If your household is quiet, this is very much a good bargain." , "Guitar"
"I like the __MASKED__ of the stand and the flexibility. Easy to put together and holds my guitar very well." , "size"
"I knoew I did not want any holder that took up too much room in my music room, not did I want something that would tip over if I blew air on it. My instructor of the __MASKED__ suggested I really read the information about all of the holders and then make my choice of the one that seemed to be light-weight yet sturdy to not fall over, looked professional, and could be the possibility of THE one I would recommend and purchase again. I really like the stability of the one I bought." , "guitar"
"This little __MASKED__ stand works very well. I like it much better than the larger stands that support a guitar by the neck." , "guitar"

"this stand is small but does the job.and folds up in to a small __MASKED__ have one for each guitar" , "package.i"
"It was cheap to buy but works just fine. I thought it might not be tall enough to hold my guitar securely but it does. The arms are coated with a soft material that prevents scratching. It is small but the arms stretch to hold almost any guitar securely. Perhaps it might be too light for a very heavy guitar. In that case, I would recommend a __MASKED__ that is taller and heavier." , "stand"
"Extremely lightweight, compact and portable, it folds up really small so that you can carry it in your guitar case, gig __MASKED__ or tuck it in the back of your amp," , "bag"
"I folds down to a very small size but is quite strong. I have a dreadnaught resting on it now, ready for use. It should work very well with any size acoustic __MASKED__. Sitting by itself, the stand is small enough to be out of the way but is able to hold my precious guitar securely when put to use. When I get another guitar, I will get another Fender stand to go with it." , "guitar"

"i play metal / hard rock and have used many different strings, these give the best __MASKED__ and depth you need to play hard music" , "tone"
"The these strings are fantastic. The sound is deep and heavy, which is exactly what I was looking for. Makes the bass __MASKED__ pretty bad @ $ $. I cranked up the bass amplifier after putting on these strings and the sound is pure, powerful, and blew me away.Well worth the money." , "sound"
"I bought this to put the new strings on my guitar but the shipping info said it wouldnt be here for a few more __MASKED__. I restrung my guitar without it and it showed up in the mail a few hours later. I can say its built much better than I thought it would be. Feels like its built to last." , "days"
"It winds well and can cut off excess string thereafter. The design also includes a bridge pin __MASKED__ that comes in handy. With some acquired technique this tool does a job." , "puller"
"bought this on a whim and I am glad of it, I have not used the string winder part yet but the cutter makes short work of both guitar and __MASKED__ strings without the risk of marring the head, just be careful you can pinch yourself if you are not careful." , "mandolin"
"It works pretty well on my ukulele, however it left several dents and scratches on the __MASKED__ of my ukulele." , "tuners"

"This is an indispensable __MASKED__ for all guitarists who constantly change strings. It is like the swiss army knife for string winding." , "tool"
"Makes stringing so much easier with the __MASKED__ puller, and cutter all in one. Arrived quick and before scheduled. These work perfect for my needs" , "peg"
"I realy like the cutter. The only thing, for me, was the peg winder was getting in the way.With just a simple screw it comes right off. I much prefer it without the __MASKED__. Build quality is awesome. Sturdy and a bit weighty. Definitley worth a buy." , "winder"
"Easy to use and makes changing out strings easy. The __MASKED__ is great, but the cutter and pin pull is also part of it making it the only tool needed for changing out strings. The construction is pretty high quality with a mix of metal and plastic parts." , "winder"
"Works a little better at winding strings than the bare-bones winders. The string cutter is very handy. The pin puller, as is usually the case, is a little __MASKED__ to use, but it works." , "clumsy"

"No messing around, fits well in bass __MASKED__ knobs, spins well and the cutter is good, this is the one to get." , "tuner"
"I have had other string winders, but this had the __MASKED__ cutter on it too. It is awesome. I broke a string on stage and instead of having a big floppy string, with just a quick squeeze it looked good. HIGHLY reccomended" , "string"
"It is a __MASKED__ winder, what more can I say. It works as it should and saves time. Very useful when restringing a guitar." , "string"

"A must have for anyone to make changing strings on any guitar especially an acoustic. Really like the clippers and bridge pin puller a __MASKED__. Would make a great gift for any musician playing a stringed instrument." , "lot"
"Great tool. I used to just coil the string ends at the __MASKED__ keys, but this trims steel and nylon with ease. The quick slack take-up winder is nice also, but requires some adjustment in technique on classical guitars" , "adjustment"
"It cuts the string and winds the __MASKED__ much easier than one could do by hand. It is very solid and will last a long time." , "pegs"

"__MASKED__ quality and love the cutter. The winder is a little awkward to use. I guess I need a little practice. But the cutters are great." , "Nice"
"I purchased this before I have ever changed a string. While waiting for it to come - I had to change one. Youtube videoed how to do it. This tool came and while it is nice and I will be sure to use it, It is not a MUST have. But I had wire snips from my jewelry __MASKED__ available. Not everyone would have those. This will work great ! It is sturdy and small." , "kit"
"Cut the strings like they was made of paper.Really good price. Did what it was suppose, no __MASKED__ to say anymore." , "need"
"Yes, you really replace your __MASKED__ very fast with this Winder. And it also cuts the strings. Very helpful. i recommend." , "strings"

"This is another useful item from Planet __MASKED__ for the guitar player. This winder saves time, especially when you are anxious to get back to playing after breaking a string or replacing every string.This is not bulky & fits into several different guitar cases without taking up much room. Worth the price." , "Waves"
"This product works well, but I still end up doing it the old fashion way. Guess I am not a gimmick __MASKED__.: - )" , "person"
"Very handy, has multiple benefits that are very useful. I just had to loosen the __MASKED__ that holds the winder a bit and lubricated it with silicone spray and done deal !" , "screw"
"This tool has high marks for one reason: It works. This is the best at combining two tools into one. Give it high marks for form and __MASKED__. Love it." , "function"
"Makes changing strings a whole lot easier. If you are a guitar __MASKED__ and are changing strings like I was without one of these, stop and get one trust me !" , "player"
"The string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design. It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job.My only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item. The shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the __MASKED__ itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item. If you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere." , "item"
"i use to use my hands to turn the tuning pegs and let me tell you that takes forever to take off strings and put them on. also my wire cutter is getting messed up from cutting strings and now that i have this i can change strings faster and i dont have to look for a wire cutter all the time.its small and can fit in the pouch of a guitar case also for people who are new to guitar you dont use this to tune its to put strings on and be careful not to over tune because you will break __MASKED__ will always be the best when you have to do precise tuning. this is just to get the tuning in the ball park and then using your hands." , "strings.hands"
"I love being able to wind the strings, pull bridge pins and cut excess string with one tool ! That frees up space in my hardshell __MASKED__ for other stuff. Seems solid and well built." , "case"
"I used this a couple of days ago to change strings on my electric guitar ( Fender Strat ). I was suprised in how well the little wire cutters worked. The __MASKED__ that turns the machine tuners is a little loose feeling but it still works well, you just have to be a little carful about not allowing it to slip and to not over tighten the strings. I highly recommend it." , "end"
"Great quality product. Saves me time winding plus includes a __MASKED__ cutter which is awesome. Highly recommended" , "string"
"Header says it all. Works well enough as a __MASKED__ winder, but I was really lookin for something to pull my bridge pins with and for me, this did not work well at all. Went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle." , "string"
"It works well for guitars and __MASKED__, so long as they are the clover style. Other then that it works just like it says it will." , "basses"
"Sometimes it seems more convenient to use my hand to turn the pegs rather than use this, but it does a pretty good job. I really like the string cutter built into the frame, and the peg puller is my favorite feature. Basically, I use this for __MASKED__ except winding strings." , "everything"
"Everything from the string cleaner to the polish works very well.You have to be very careful with the __MASKED__ cleaner because it will dry out the fretboard but the conditioner is included and can be applied after.The string cleaner does not really leave much residue and really does help with string noise.You wont be let down.Dunlop makes good quality products." , "fretboard"
"I love this system. Every time I change strings now, I go through every step of this system, and what a difference it has made. The fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great. I never realized how dry the wood was. The string cleaner is nice too. I feel like I was neglecting my guitars until I got this. The __MASKED__ of product in this kit are good, and the instructions are clear. The two polishing cloths are adequate size, and washable." , "quantities"

"This set is not for everyone ! In fact, you might have to get the neck adjusted after installing this set. While I can see rockers laying down overpowering riffs with these my goal is to get the lowest action I can on a jazz box. No question about the quality, though, these hold up the same fine __MASKED__ as the other Slinky sets." , "standards"
"They work great. You can buy more expensive guitar __MASKED__, just not better guitar strings. I use these on an old Gibson semi-hollow body." , "strings"
"I play Progressive and __MASKED__ metal, and these strings hold out nicely. Tuned them down to A sharp ( b flat ? ) and they sounded sweet. Back up to E ( standard ) and they provide nice full sounding tone." , "Thrash"
"So these are heavy strings that work well. I did have an issue with the strings messing with my bridge on my guitar but with some more __MASKED__ it worked well enough." , "springs"
"these heavy gauge are the main strings I use. Detune great, good harmonics, great presence, I use them across a whole range of genres, from Death __MASKED__ to Blues to Funk and beyond !" , "metal"
"I read a review saying that there bridge was floating out & the strings were hard to tune aswell as their e string popping. I had the exact same experience but i bought two sets since i know uncoated strings dont last long. so i did get to play em but all my strings ( except the A & __MASKED__ ) popped on both sets within two weeks i knew it was due to my bridge being made to use a whammy bar ( which it came with btw ) & the tension it put on my tuning pegs what really got me upset about these strings was that they damaged my tuning pegs and now there harder to turn ( have to use pliers sometimes ) but the strings sound great & if i get a better guitar i might get these more often but for now im staying w/ medium gauge elixirs." , "E"
"I chose these strings based on reviews I have read on the website. I was definitely not disappointed. This string __MASKED__ great on solid body electric and hollow body. I have a Dot Studio and the resonance is great for rockabilly. My son loves them for metal. We will continue to use Beefy Slinky strings !" , "sound"
"Purchased these strings after having tried the Blue Steel strings. My son much prefers the Elixir __MASKED__. They last a lot longer than the Blue Steel strings did and he says the Elixir sound better, too." , "strings"
"These are the best strings you can buy, __MASKED__. There is hardly any noise whilst your fingers slide over the strings when you change chords. I tried other strings but I always come back to Elixir." , "IMHO"
"This installed easily. A nice feature is __MASKED__ to unclip the shoulder pad from the mounts on the instrument. When the pad is installed the strap is very comfortable and eased any shoulder pain I might have had with earlier straps. A keeper for sure." , "ability"
"Padded portion of strap is quite soft and comfortable.Both ends are a loop. You disonnect the quick __MASKED__ buckles and loop ends through banjo head retainer rods. Easy to do, and you can vary locationGood Product - I would from this manufacturer again." , "release"

"I use mediums but bought these for my nephews Takamine and they sound awesome on that guitar. Always love these strings. This __MASKED__ has not changed his strings in years so I thought I would give hem the best chance of keeping his guitar sounding good for as long as possible." , "kid"
"Great set of strings. Cant go wrong with elixirs a little over priced but I am hoping to get long __MASKED__ out of them to make up for it." , "life"
"They feel great, last longer than any other __MASKED__ I ever used and most importantly, they sound terrific. The medium weight also has a better tone than thinner gauges. My Taylor is much louder now that I use these.However, you may have to adjust your truss rod if you change from lite or extra light." , "string"

"These strings sound amazing. They also last for a really long __MASKED__ and keep sounding amazing. I get better harmonics with these strings as well." , "time"
"I tend to sweat when I play, so coated strings are a necessity for me. These are as good as any coated string on the market, I prefer the thinner coating and super light strings. Everyone has their preferences so you should try a few different gauges and manufacturers until you find your favorite string. These provide an nice smooth feel while providing excellent tone and they last reasonably well. Of course that depends on your playing style and how much your fingers sweat when you play ! Oh, and do yourself a favor and store your guitars in their cases when you are not playing them. The guitar and the __MASKED__ will last longer and thank you for it." , "strings"

"Been a fan of these for years now. I occasionally use other strings for fun, but these will always be my __MASKED__ to strings every time.

"These Elixir Nanoweb acoustic guitar strings are amazing because they sound like new strings for a long time ( months ) unlike other guitar strings. Great product.

Ive tried MANY different kinds of strings for my acoustics and the Elixir Nanowebs are by far the best strings I have ever played.I had a set of another major brand on a cheap Washburn I bought, and I changed them out with these strings and WOW what a HUGE difference.

"The four-way diagram that comes with the switch does not tell you which side to use. Both sides have five tabs and look the same from the above diagram given no matter which way you turn it. I figured it would go the same way as the three-way - wrong. You think Fender would have the sense to figure this out, and give us a proper diagram, but guess again. Just another __MASKED__ of the incompetence at Fender." , "example"
"Great solid switch. Works well for giving your Telecaster the option to run your pickups in both series and parallel. As for those who have questioned if the travel is too much for some switch plates all I can say is that I have this in several of my Teles and I have never had a problem with the __MASKED__ travel being too much for the plate." , "switch"
"Looked like the __MASKED__ was cheesey and they ended up breaking but they worked while they were used in a guitar with the proper pinhole next to the screw position" , "chrome"

"I really like this over the capo that came in my guitar bundle from Austin Bazaar, so after some research online and talking to friends, I bought this capo.It goes on easily, comes off easily and does not mar the finish of my guitar.

"I was impressed by the quality of this product. It is simple and does its job well. Easy to release and will work with a fat neck acoustic or Les Paul or with a thin neck on most metal __MASKED__. Holds strings tight and is easy to place with no fret noise. Was a great value." , "Guitars"
"I used to use a Schubb Capo, but started using the Dunlop Trigger a few __MASKED__ ago and never looked back. The fit can be a little tight, especially higher up on the fretboard, but I personally like this, mostly for the fact there are less moving parts ( compared to a Schubb ) and the fit is nice and secure." , "years"
"The only negative to this well made capo is I wish the tension was slightly less. I find that once placed, notes played closer to it are slightly sharp even using light pressure.

"So good that I bought another one. Love the heavy cord and gold connectors. Guitar sounds great. I just learned last night how to coil them up. I guess I should read instructions more carefully. But no __MASKED__ done, still works great !" , "harm"
"I thought I was using good guitar cables but I kept getting intermittence with one.So I tried this Monster cable. It eliminated the __MASKED__ only minor complaint is that it is very stiff. This is minor but no matter what I do it curls up unless you have it fully extended.I would still recommend it though." , "problem.My"
"__MASKED__ Cable is one of the things on earth we can count on ! Seriously speaking all my cables are Monsters, yes they are pricy and sometimes very much, true.But they last really lifetime and I never ever had to complain or heard a friend complaining on Monster products.PEACE" , "Monster"
"It is a great option, if not simply the best. Monster knows it all in __MASKED__. Gob bless monster everyway" , "quality"
"Quality is there in construction and signal passing. We never have problems with our Monster gold cables. Conversely, we have other __MASKED__ crap out on us periodically." , "cables"
"I would def recommend this to anyone but for electric only. If you are going to be playing acoustic I would get their specific acoustic __MASKED__. This is a very heavy guage. Sounds great !" , "cable"
"Very well made. No __MASKED__. Should be able to stand up to any use or abuse." , "problems"
"The plastic is pretty lightweight, but it is a big help. I keep various guitar picks, clips, __MASKED__, etc. on it which kept falling off when I just set them in front of the music. Glad I bought it." , "pencils"
"I bought this for my __MASKED__ acoustic guitar so she could play through an amp. It fits very well and sounds great !" , "daughters"
"This mic is fine. One should know that it has quite low gain and requires the __MASKED__ of a boost/preamp for the guitar sound to be heard." , "use"
"Could not get to fit small sound hole. Once in sound __MASKED__ pickup did not work at all. Would not buy it." , "hole"
"I have been using the EXPs for some __MASKED__ now on electic-acoustics and they have become my go-to string. I find the coating to be less noticeable than on El * * * rs and tonal variations to be less from string to string and set-to-set. Highly recommended." , "time"
"We have an old acoustic around the house, but I rarely play it, opting instead for the electric. This is going to be hard to believe, but the strings on the acoustic were last changed more than two __MASKED__ ago.When we put these new strings on the guitar ( Lotus ), the sound, as you might imagine, was incredible -- bright and clear.These are fairly pricey, but I am very impressed with the quality." , "decades"
"These __MASKED__ last and they moderated some of the booming I get from other strings. I use the EXP Phosphor bronze on my other dreads." , "strings"
"These strings sound great. I Love the sustained bright tone. They work well with my __MASKED__ top guitar. Easy on the fingers too." , "cedar"
"not worth the price or matched the hype that you hear and read about. GHS strings are much cheaper and much better strings than these. I think they lasted a week on my guitar until I could get some more GHS or __MASKED__ Acoustics on it." , "Slinky"
"are hard to beat when it comes to __MASKED__. ( except the steel ones ). I use it when I travel on a plane especially" , "durability"
"This is the best case ever for the money ! I have purchased four other cases and none are as well constructed as the __MASKED__ Deluxe. I like this case so much, I plan to purchase two more this week." , "Gator"
"Works perfectly for both my Martin dreadnought and my Fender Stratocaster. Solid unit, good material and construction, though it is made in China apparently -- but hey __MASKED__ why its such a bargain !" , "thats"
"Well built and solid stand. It keeps the guitar well protected and looks nice too. Some stands hold the guitar with only a hallowed little tube on the bottom, which breaks easily from the weight of the __MASKED__. This stand holds the guitar with two solid metal bars, which should last a long time. It can hold both acoustic and electric guitars. Highly recommend it." , "guitar"
"very well made of heavy metal framework. has a very solid __MASKED__. the neoprene sleeve is thick and soft enough to protect your guitar. the top neck clasp keeps the guitar from tipping forward and the quick release really works. probably the best stand." , "base"
"__MASKED__ had one for years. Has survived many gigs and rehearsals, and many months in the trunk of my car. Harsh environment !" , "Have"
"This does what you expect, it stands up a guitar. What can else can be said ? It has a swing lever that keeps the instrument an an unfortunate __MASKED__. It is portable, folds up easily for storage. I usually have a guitar on it all the time." , "accidents"
"Not easy to set up, hard to tighten down. __MASKED__ well enough as a filter once you get it placed." , "Works"
"Its poorly made with __MASKED__ to detail. I ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at Amazon. But they will not screw down all the way and are losse. It is useless ! ! ! Other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine." , "attention"
"I bought this compression pedal to give my leads a little extra oomph and it does just that. When playing hammer-ons and pull-offs, sometimes it can be difficult to get them to sound as loud as the rest of your picking, but not when using this pedal. It amplifies your quieter sounds and levels off the louder ones to give a smoothe sound. Works great if used correctly. Not to be used with dynamic picking sounds because you will lose that louder/softer sound.I use this with a Gibson Les Paul, and __MASKED__ Hollowbody through a Fender Super Champ amp along with other pedals. It can cause some major feedback if using heavy distortion." , "Washburn"
"This is a great pedal to have in your setup, for those times you want a clean sound that will cut through the mix, yet will not just sound blaringly loud and undefined. I used a Boss compression pedal for many years, and the Dyna __MASKED__ was definitely a refreshing step in the right direction. It just sounds more organic, and less sterile than the Boss Pedal. I also think in this case, less is more, as far as the controls are concerned." , "Comp"
"I like MXR products however I am always Leary of the metal __MASKED__ on pedals because of the possibility of the pop factor. The dyna comp does still equal out my sound from clean to overdrive. A must for pedal boards." , "button"
"This is actually a very sturdy yet light weight drum throne. The only issue I have is that the seat can swivel if not tightened properly, allowing the bolt to scratch the metal __MASKED__ ( not a big deal )." , "post"
"Comes with Adapter.This thing controls your tone so well ! ! ! ! ! Everything about it is just so much worth the money __MASKED__ starting to fall in love with MXR !" , "im"
"I use is this mount to support a Samson meteor mic. It works great. I would definitely buy this again. The mounting is designed to work on any diameter microphone stand. It has good positive adjustments even with a heavy __MASKED__ on the end." , "mic"
"Really great __MASKED__, fastens to a vertical pipe very securely, great quality. A very nice addition to my collection. I highly recommend." , "clamp"
"I was very skeptical to buy a Wuhan china because ive had bad experiences before and their quality control is almost non-existent.That being said, the __MASKED__ I received is amazing its a nice thick little cymbal and has a great sharp tone and fast decay.My opinion of Wuhan has been raised quite a bit." , "china"
"If looking for that oriental sound, this is it. Nicely made. Some folks expect something different, I suspect. It is not a cymbal that you use like a crash or ride, it is more like a __MASKED__ and at that it is for use for a particular sound. Highly recommend, And when I bought it was very well priced - like half what I could find used ( and this was NEW ! )." , "splash"
"I have a Boss OD which I realize now matches well with my little Vox tube amp, so I use this Bad Monkey pedal when I go direct for low level or headphone playing. Good __MASKED__, good tone, pretty versatile, but I like the mid boost and harmonics I get from the Boss. The BM might work better with solid state." , "price"
"Virtually eliminates all outside sound, allowing you to dial in a comfortable volume during rehersal and recording __MASKED__. Nice, flat response." , "sessions"
"These do a great __MASKED__ at passively eliminating noise while allowing you to hear your metronome ( or a mix from a soundboard ) perfectly. They are certainly worth the price." , "job"
"these do a good job of isolating out the __MASKED__. They work very well. Would recommend it to other people" , "sound"
"these things muffle sound great. they have good __MASKED__ quality. perfect for recording loud drums. perfect for drowning out people" , "sound"
"Works perfectly. Nice feel to it and seems sturdy. You just have to remember not to turn on the __MASKED__ with your foot down otherwise it switches polarity and does the opposite of what you want it to." , "keyboard"
"Great accessary for Yamaha keyboards. Fits and works well. Very adequate __MASKED__, should last for many hours of playing at home or out !" , "construction"
"Does what it should and __MASKED__ quality. The price seems very good for what you get out of this pedal. I am using on a Yamaha board." , "Yamaha"
"I bought it just so I could learn a little __MASKED__ of guitar. It sounds good and looks really nice. I get compliments on it." , "bit"
"I have many expensive cases for my guitars and recently started playing bass, but not too serious just wanted a nice little case for it. Boy was i surprised, this case is awesome, great quality, fits bass without any problems and the storage __MASKED__ is great. Definetly reccomend this case" , "inside"
"I had a Cannon brand clutch and I bought this one to replace it. What I like about this one is how the release __MASKED__ works. On the Cannon the lever was vertical. This made actuating it a less natural motion. With this one you hit it with a down stroke of your stick and it releases. That motion is much more natural and this makes it easier to use. An argument could be made that this one coule be easier to actuate accidentally but I have had no issue with it.Aside from the actuation of the release it is also well made and works very well." , "lever"
"It works well as a standard clutch, as a drop clutch its very iffy. the top __MASKED__ spins around when you hit the lever so you have to grab it and move it back so you can hit it again." , "part"
"I like to hit things. I use drums so nobody else gets hurt. I need the sticks to most effectively channel my aggression into the drums and not, say, local wildlife. These have the sweetest tone for battery-based abuse. __MASKED__ Vic ! Also, flammable !" , "Thanks"
"I have always liked these sticks. They are solid, look good and feel good. You will always get quality from vic firth. Only downer is they seem to break faster then some __MASKED__ such as Vaders." , "sticks"
"These sticks are solid __MASKED__, which is insanely durable, and sounds great for classic rock, and punk rock drums. These sticks are weight, and sound matched, so each pair will sound and feel almost identical." , "hickory"
"easy to install, holds the guitar away from the wall somewhat, and keeps it off of the __MASKED__ away from the animals when I have it out of the case. great find, well worth the purchase price.: )" , "floor"
